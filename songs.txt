"The place where I come from is a small town

 To let those big words come right out"

"Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
 Where the neon madmen climb
 They all fall there so perfectly
 It all seems so well timed
 And here I sit so patiently
 Waiting to find out what price
 You have to pay to get out of
 Going through all these things twice"

"And you sit there and talk revolution
 but can you tell me just who's in command?
 When you tell me the forces we are fighting
 then I'll gladly join and make plans.
 But for now only our t-shirts cry freedom
 and our voices are gagged by our greed
 our minds are harnessed by knowledge
 by the hill and the will to succeed."

 kein Alkohol, kein Nikotin.

 mit viel Oktan und frei von Blei:
 einen Kraftstoff wie Benzin"
