Niles:   "Sorry I'm late, Frasier. Just as we were leaving, [my wife] 
          had a run-in with a rude directory assistance operator, and 
          it shattered her calm.
Frasier: "You know, Niles, have you ever considered that maybe Maris is 
          a bit high-strung, that maybe she should see someone?"
Niles:   "She's seen everyone.

          Frasier?"

Frasier: "The thought of a doctor selling things is kind of
          distasteful, isn't it?

Frasier: "Dr Sneezy is a cartoon character. The fact that he's a giant
          purple hippopotamus probably should have tipped you off."

Niles: "All my life I have dreamed of one thing: the day I could go
        into a library, go to the card catalogue and see my name under
        `Mental Illness'."
